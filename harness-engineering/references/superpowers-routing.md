# Superpowers Routing

## Rule

Do not assume `superpowers:*` skills exist in the target environment.

Before routing to a companion workflow, check the current skill list for matching local governance skills. Local governance skills own layer, boundary, role isolation, readiness, contract, verification, and review/next decisions. `superpowers:*` skills are companion execution workflows, not replacements for matching local governance skills.

Do not hardcode a user's skill directory. Use the skill paths exposed in the current session or the active environment's skill discovery mechanism.

For each routed workflow:

1. Select and load any matching local governance skills first.
2. Check whether the named `superpowers:*` skill is available in the current skill list.
3. If available, use it as a companion workflow after local governance rules are known.
4. If unavailable, say it is unavailable and use the local fallback.
5. Stop only when the route is explicitly marked `required`.

## Routing Matrix

| Situation | Preferred companion | Local fallback | Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creative product, feature, or design work | `superpowers:brainstorming` | `brainstorm-to-brief` | preferred |
| Multi-step implementation planning | `superpowers:writing-plans` | `planning-with-files` or project queue | preferred |
| Executing a written plan | `superpowers:executing-plans` | `harness-engineering` queue plus checkpoints | preferred |
| Independent parallel tasks | `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` | Execute serially and record handoff state | optional |
| Bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Reproduce, observe, isolate, fix, verify; use `debugging-checklist` only for human handoff | preferred |
| Feature or bugfix implementation | `superpowers:test-driven-development` | `contract-first-development` plus target-local tests | preferred |
| Before claiming completion, fixed, or passing | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Run explicit verification commands and report evidence | preferred |
| Receiving review feedback | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | Default code-review stance: verify, challenge unclear feedback, then patch | preferred |
| Requesting review before merge | `superpowers:requesting-code-review` | Run local review checklist and verification | optional |
| Finishing a branch | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | `review-next-governance` plus git status, commit, and push workflow | optional |
| Creating or updating skills | `superpowers:writing-skills` | `skill-creator` when available; otherwise keep frontmatter concise and validate | preferred |
| Starting isolated feature work | `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` | Use current workspace unless user or project rules require isolation | optional |

## Disclosure Template

When a preferred companion is unavailable, say:

```text
Preferred companion skill <skill-name> is unavailable in this environment. Continuing with <local-fallback>.
```

Do not claim the companion workflow was executed unless its `SKILL.md` was actually loaded.

When a companion workflow overlaps local governance, report:

```text
Local governance skills: <selected local skills>
Companion workflow skills: <selected companion skills>
Loaded SKILL.md files: <success/failure list>
Routing decision: local governance owns <layer/boundary/readiness/etc.>; companion workflow executes <workflow>.
```
