# Change Packet Model

## Purpose

Use a change packet as a temporary, durable work folder for complex changes. It keeps proposal, design, tasks, contracts, and verification context together while the harness layer model remains the authority.

The packet is a carrier, not a gate. Harness layers still decide what can move next.

## When To Use

Create or request a packet when at least one condition is true:

- The work spans two or more harness layers.
- The work touches multiple modules, services, repositories, tools, or runtimes.
- The work will likely continue across multiple agent sessions.
- The work needs ADR, contract, readiness, implementation, and verification context linked together.
- NEXT, TODO, backlog, or checkpoint text would become too large if it held all context.
- The user asks for OpenSpec-like proposal, design, task, spec delta, or archive behavior.

Do not use a packet for:

- A single command or direct factual answer.
- A narrow one-file documentation edit.
- A small bugfix whose contract and verification path are already obvious.
- Work already fully captured by an existing ADR, contract, issue, or checkpoint.

## Suggested Shape

Prefer a project-local convention over importing a tool-specific layout:

```text
docs/changes/
  <change-id>/
    proposal.md
    design.md
    tasks.md
    contracts.md
    verification.md
```

If the project already has another durable task packet convention, adapt this model to that convention instead of creating a competing source of truth.

## File Responsibilities

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `proposal.md` | Goal, motivation, scope, non-goals, affected users or systems. |
| `design.md` | Boundaries, responsibilities, data/control flow, alternatives, ADR candidates. |
| `tasks.md` | Layered task list with current blocking layer and ready/blocked state. |
| `contracts.md` | Schemas, fixtures, examples, API shapes, probes, checks, and acceptance criteria. |
| `verification.md` | Commands, evidence, failures, freshness, screenshots, traces, and remaining risk. |

Keep each file short. Move stable conclusions into the long-lived project sources instead of letting the packet become permanent documentation.

## Layer Relationship

| Harness layer | Packet use |
|---|---|
| Idea / Brainstorming | Capture intent, options, risks, and non-goals. |
| Brief | Fix goal, success criteria, and current exclusions. |
| Architecture | Record boundaries, data flow, ownership, and ADR candidates. |
| ADR | Link to accepted decisions; do not replace ADRs with packet prose. |
| Contract | Link to schemas, fixtures, examples, probes, and checks. |
| Readiness | Confirm target-local rules, verification commands, and scope limits. |
| Implementation | Track only approved implementation slices. Do not expand scope from tasks alone. |
| Verification | Record fresh evidence and unresolved failures. |
| Review / Next | Archive stable conclusions back to official project state. |

## Status Rules

Use simple status words:

```text
draft
ready
active
blocked
done
archived
```

Rules:

- `ready` means the current layer has enough durable evidence to proceed.
- `active` means work is in progress at the stated layer.
- `blocked` must state the missing evidence, decision, contract, or external condition.
- `done` means the packet goal is satisfied, but archive may still be pending.
- `archived` means stable conclusions were copied or linked back to official project sources.

## Archive Rules

Before marking a packet archived, check whether stable conclusions need to be reflected in:

- ADR or decision notes.
- Schemas, fixtures, examples, probes, or checks.
- Verification documentation or verification records.
- NEXT, TODO, backlog, or checkpoint state.
- Documentation maps, README navigation, or agent instructions.

If a conclusion stays only inside the packet, the packet is not archived.

## Queue Integration

Queue items may point to a packet instead of repeating context:

```text
[ready] Implement public projection contract fixture
Layer: contract
Change: docs/changes/public-projection-contract/
Evidence: contracts.md#fixtures
```

The queue remains the scheduler. The packet remains the context holder.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---|---|
| Treating packet tasks as implementation approval. | Readiness and contract gates still decide implementation. |
| Creating packets for every small task. | Use packets only when context would otherwise fragment. |
| Letting packets become permanent docs. | Archive stable conclusions back to official sources. |
| Replacing ADRs with `design.md`. | Use `design.md` to identify ADR candidates, then write ADRs. |
| Replacing checks with `contracts.md`. | Use `contracts.md` to link or specify executable checks. |
| Hiding blocked scope inside a packet. | Mirror blocked state to the project queue or checkpoint. |

## Minimal Decision Check

Before creating a packet, answer:

```text
Will a future agent need more than the queue item, ADR, and contract files to resume safely?
```

If yes, create or request a packet. If no, keep the existing harness artifacts lean.
